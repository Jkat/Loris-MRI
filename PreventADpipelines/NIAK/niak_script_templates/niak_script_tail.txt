% General
opt.folder_out  = '/home/cmadjar/database/PreventAD/cecile/ASL_out/PRE_ASL_fmri_preprocess_niak/';    % Where to store the results
opt.size_output = 'quality_control';                             % The amount of outputs that are generated by the pipeline. 'all' will keep intermediate outputs, 'quality_control' will only keep the quality control outputs. 

% Slice timing correction (niak_brick_slice_timing)
opt.slice_timing.type_acquisition = 'sequential descending'; % Slice timing order (available options : 'sequential ascending', 'sequential descending', 'interleaved ascending', 'interleaved descending')
opt.slice_timing.type_scanner     = 'Siemens';                % Scanner manufacturer. Only the value 'Siemens' will actually have an impact
opt.slice_timing.delay_in_tr      = 0.05;                       % The delay in TR ("blank" time between two volumes)
opt.slice_timing.suppress_vol     = 0;                       % Number of dummy scans to suppress.
opt.slice_timing.flag_skip        = 1;                       % Skip the slice timing (0: don't skip, 1 : skip)

% Motion estimation (niak_pipeline_motion)
opt.motion.session_ref  = 'session1'; % The session that is used as a reference. In general, use the session including the acqusition of the T1 scan.

% resampling in stereotaxic space
opt.resample_vol.interpolation = 'trilinear'; % The resampling scheme. The most accurate is 'sinc' but it is awfully slow
opt.resample_vol.voxel_size    = [3 3 3];     % The voxel size to use in the stereotaxic space
opt.resample_vol.flag_skip     = 1;           % Skip resampling (data will stay in native functional space after slice timing/motion correction) (0: don't skip, 1 : skip)

% Linear and non-linear fit of the anatomical image in the stereotaxic
% space (niak_brick_t1_preprocess)
opt.t1_preprocess.nu_correct.arg = '-distance 50'; % Parameter for non-uniformity correction. 200 is a suggested value for 1.5T images, 50 for 3T images. If you find that this stage did not work well, this parameter is usually critical to improve the results.

% T1-T2 coregistration (niak_brick_anat2func)
opt.anat2func.init = 'identity'; % An initial guess of the transform. Possible values 'identity', 'center'. 'identity' is self-explanatory. The 'center' option usually does more harm than good. Use it only if you have very big misrealignement between the two images (say, 2 cm).

% Temporal filtering (niak_brick_time_filter)
opt.time_filter.hp = 0.01; % Cut-off frequency for high-pass filtering, or removal of low frequencies (in Hz). A cut-off of -Inf will result in no high-pass filtering.
opt.time_filter.lp = Inf;  % Cut-off frequency for low-pass filtering, or removal of high frequencies (in Hz). A cut-off of Inf will result in no low-pass filtering.

% Regression of confounds and scrubbing (niak_brick_regress_confounds)
opt.regress_confounds.flag_wm = false;            % Turn on/off the regression of the average white matter signal (true: apply / false : don't apply)
opt.regress_confounds.flag_vent = false;          % Turn on/off the regression of the average of the ventricles (true: apply / false : don't apply)
opt.regress_confounds.flag_motion_params = false; % Turn on/off the regression of the motion parameters (true: apply / false : don't apply)
opt.regress_confounds.flag_gsc = false;          % Turn on/off the regression of the PCA-based estimation of the global signal (true: apply / false : don't apply)
opt.regress_confounds.flag_scrubbing = false;     % Turn on/off the scrubbing of time frames with excessive motion (true: apply / false : don't apply)
opt.regress_confounds.thre_fd = 0.5;             % The threshold on frame displacement that is used to determine frames with excessive motion in the scrubbing procedure

% Correction of physiological noise (niak_pipeline_corsica)
opt.corsica.sica.nb_comp             = 60;    % Number of components estimated during the ICA. 20 is a minimal number, 60 was used in the validation of CORSICA.
opt.corsica.threshold                = 0.15;  % This threshold has been calibrated on a validation database as providing good sensitivity with excellent specificity.
opt.corsica.flag_skip                = 1;     % Skip CORSICA (0: don't skip, 1 : skip). Even if it is skipped, ICA results will be generated for quality-control purposes. The method is not currently considered to be stable enough for production unless it is manually supervised.

% Spatial smoothing (niak_brick_smooth_vol)
opt.smooth_vol.fwhm      = 6;  % Full-width at maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian blurring kernel, in mm.
opt.smooth_vol.flag_skip = 1;  % Skip spatial smoothing (0: don't skip, 1 : skip)
